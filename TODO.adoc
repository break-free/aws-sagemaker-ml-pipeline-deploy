- Destroy all ECR container images and SageMaker Endpoint, Endpoint Configuration, and Models in a script
    - Use `aws` CLI to list above resources.
    - Parse the JSON to retrieve the necessary items.
    - Loop through the items and destroy each with the appropriate command.

- Separate the Terraform code from any `src` container/model code.
    - Keep in separate repositories.
    - Establish naming convention for the AWS Step Function.
    - Use the Step Function for other models in separate repo's.
    - Need to ensure that once models are completed that any SageMaker resources (specifically Endpoint, Endpoint Configuration, and Models) are destroyed.
